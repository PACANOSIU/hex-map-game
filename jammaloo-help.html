[15:23] <bo_knows> if has a HexagonGrid function and a bunch of prototypes
[15:23] <bo_knows> ideally, I'd like to separate the prototypes into different files
[15:24] <bo_knows> would I be able to do that this way?
[15:24] <jarofghosts> you could
[15:24] <jarofghosts> each file would just have Map.prototype.functionName = function(blah) { ... }

[15:25] <bo_knows> I want it to not be confusing  haha
[15:25] <bo_knows> right now it's all in 1 file and getting unruly
[15:25] <jarofghosts> Map's constructor and methods should all be in one file
[15:25] <bo_knows> because I'm encapsulating the entire thing in 1 function so that my data can be passed to it from .success
[15:26] <jarofghosts> and whatever consumes it should live elsewhere
[15:26] <jarofghosts> what you want to do is more like what i showed in my example
[15:26] <jarofghosts> when the ajax request completes, store the mapdata as a property of the map instance
[15:26] <jarofghosts> so that other methods can refer to it
[15:26] <jarofghosts> so you dont have to do that

<bo_knows> yeah
[15:27] <bo_knows> also, TIL you could do console.log("Map:", mapData)    text then an object using a comma
[15:28] <bo_knows> ha!
[15:28] <jarofghosts> haha
[15:29] <bo_knows> so, if I have this HexagonGrid

[15:29] <bo_knows> and it has prototypes
[15:29] <bo_knows> like HexagonGrid.prototype.drawHex
[15:29] <jarofghosts> those are methods
[15:29] <bo_knows> I'd have to call it like map.prototype.HexagonGrid.prototype.drawHex ??
[15:30] <bo_knows> Bear with me.  I'm probably starting this project that is way too complicated for my knowledge level.
[15:30] <jarofghosts> so it would be useful to learn how prototypes work in javascript
[15:30] <jarofghosts> suffice to say
[15:30] <jarofghosts> when you call new Map
[15:31] <jarofghosts> what happens is the Map function (the constructor) is ran
[15:31] <bo_knows> right
[15:31] <bo_knows> with the method getData in there
[15:31] <jarofghosts> and the object returned will have access to whatever is set up in that constructor, plus any methods defined on its prototype
[15:32] <jarofghosts> so thats why i recommended moving getData out of the constructor

[15:54] <bo_knows> so I read through to methods
[15:54] <jarofghosts> ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ
[15:54] <bo_knows> is it not possible to assign the data from map.getData(displayData) to a variable?
[15:55] <bo_knows> var data = map.getData(displayData);
[15:55] <bo_knows> in the global namespace
[15:55] <jarofghosts> you would assign within the callback, but it would be much more useful to have it be a property of the map instance
[15:55] <jarofghosts> mostly because global variables are bad++

    [21:52] <danecando> got it let me take a look
[21:53] <bo_knows> ok
[21:53] <bo_knows> its a bit messy, so feel free to ask questions
[21:53] <bo_knows> I appreciate any help
[22:01] <danecando> is the methods in hexagon grid  taking any data from the enclosing scope or is it all being passed in through the arguments it looks like
[22:01] <bo_knows> well, it does use the "map" object, which is inside the scope of loadedMap()
[22:02] <bo_knows> everything else is arguments
[22:02] <bo_knows> before I even used AJAX for DB data, it was all global
[22:03] <danecando> because ideally you would probably want to separate the hexagon object into another file and it's just operating on the data that you get from your ajax call
[22:03] <danecando> and in the 2nd paste bin
[22:04] <bo_knows> I do want it separate
[22:04] <bo_knows> thats the point
[22:05] <danecando> you could structure it like that and operate on the data in the get data callback
[22:05] <bo_knows> even every HexagonGrid.prototype could be a separate file
[22:06] <bo_knows> so, using that 2nd pastebin as an example, how/where would i start the HexagonGrid object?
[22:08] <danecando> you would start it in the get data callback
[22:09] <danecando> and it would essentially be the same concept as your original
[22:09] <bo_knows> inside map.getData(function(map_data) {}   ?
[22:09] <danecando> where the function inside of get data  =
[22:09] <danecando> function loadedMap(map, mapProperties){
[22:10] <danecando> just structured a little bit fancier
[22:10] <danecando> you might wanna get help from somebody more advanced then me tho :p
[22:10] <bo_knows> heh   I've been trying
[22:10] <bo_knows> jarofghosts was helping me earlier, but I had to bail because my 2yr old woke up from his nap
[22:11] <danecando> i just like looking at problems to make my brain do something
[22:11] <danecando> is he the one that made the 2nd paste?
[22:11] <bo_knows> he did, but he didn't fully understand what I needed
[22:11] <bo_knows> I sent him my code after that
[22:13] <danecando> yea but it seems to me like you could easily call  var hexagonGrid = new HexagonGrid("HexCanvas", 30); right inside of map.getdata function as it essentially the same as the loaded map function
[22:13] <danecando> there should be no reason why hexagon grid object needs to be declared inside of that function
[22:13] <bo_knows> hmm... ddin't even think of that
    
    
    Can I create a HexagonGrid method/property with mapData in there?

    4:59] <Jammaloo1> Depends on the data
[14:59] <bo_knows> the data in question is where I clicked, and where I clicked previously.  Those 2 things determine a lot of things in my "game"
