hex-map
=======

This project is my first attempt at doing javascript or canvas coding.  

I've always been intrigued by turn-based games like Risk, and have always dreamt of doing hexagonal maps if I were to learn enough javascript.  Well, here is that project.

Overall features to-do list:
- Highlight a given hex
	- Unhighlight on another click [DONE]
- Add a "properties" object to track various properties for each hex
	- Terrain type [DONE]
		- Terrain bonuses?
	- Player ownership
	- Amount/Type of units occupying
- Basic combat mechanics
	- Dice rolling
		- combat modifiers
	- Track amount of units for each hex
		- Save in mySQL DB
